## Introduction

The neural network architecture includes classes for `Connection`, `Neuron`, and `Network`. It's a basic implementation to understand the principles of backpropagation and feedforward neural networks.

## Installation

To use this implementation, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you will require the `numpy` library. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Transcendental-Programmer/neural-network-from-scratch.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd neural-network-from-scratch
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python neural_network.py
```

## Example

To demonstrate the network's capabilities, we've included an example that trains the network to perform the XOR logical operation.
